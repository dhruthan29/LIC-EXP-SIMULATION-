# INFERENCE
.For a differential amplifier to work properly, you need to set the MOSFETs in their active region (saturation region for long-channel MOSFETs). This typically involves proper sizing of resistors, current sources, and gate voltages
. Varry the MOSFET length and width (m1&m2)get calculated id current in dc analysis
.set the Ac amplitude as 1 in the ac analysis
. From the frequency response, you can determine the bandwidth of the differential amplifier by identifying the frequency
Differential Gain: It's like a magnifying glass for differences. It makes the tiny differences between two signals much easier to see.

Common-Mode Rejection: Think of noise-canceling headphones. They block out background noise and let you hear the important sounds clearly.

Biasing and Stability: Imagine balancing a seesaw perfectly so it stays level. Proper biasing keeps everything balanced, and stability ensures it stays that way over time.

Practical Limitations: In real life, nothing is perfect. Small variations in components can lead to minor differences in performance, just like using slightly different ingredients in a recipe can change the final dish a bit.
# RESULT
.By varrying Mosfet width and length we get id current 0.45mA
m1 and m2 L=180nm w=7.8nm
.RSS value 777ohm and rd=3.3kohm
: A flat gain curve around the middle frequencies, e.g., gain might be around 20 dB in the mid-frequency range.
The input signals Vin1 and Vin2 might look like sinusoidal waves with small differences.
